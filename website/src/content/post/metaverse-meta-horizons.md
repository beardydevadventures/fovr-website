## Bridging Realities How Meta Horizons Advances the Metaverse Concept

At FoVR Interactive, we see Meta Horizons as a promising step towards a more open and accessible metaverse, aligning with our vision of XR-driven interaction. Finally getting access to it in Australia in June 2024 has been a significant milestone. The idea of the metaverse has long been a topic of futuristic speculation, but with platforms like Meta Horizons, we are witnessing its tangible evolution. Meta Horizons is more than just a VR social space, it is a bridge between the digital and the real world, allowing people to interact, create, and explore without barriers. One of its greatest strengths lies in its accessibility, not only for those who own VR headsets, but also for those who prefer to engage through traditional devices such as browsers and mobile phones.

## Bridging the Digital and Physical Worlds

Meta Horizons plays a crucial role in making virtual spaces more inclusive. While VR provides an unparalleled immersive experience, it is essential that access to these digital worlds is not restricted to those who can afford or operate the technology. By offering alternative access points, such as desktop, browser, and mobile integrations, Meta Horizons ensures that everyone can participate in the metaverse, regardless of their technological setup. This approach democratises digital experiences and fosters a sense of belonging among users with varying levels of tech adoption.

## What You Can Do in Meta Horizons Worlds

Meta Horizons is designed to be a dynamic and social space where users can engage in a variety of activities. Some of the key things you can do in Meta Horizons include:

- Socialise and Explore – Join public or private spaces to interact with friends or meet new people in virtual communities.
- Host and Attend Events – Organise meetups, workshops, concerts, or business meetings in immersive virtual settings.
- Learn and Discover – Experience educational content, virtual museums, and art exhibits that bring knowledge to life in new ways.
- Create and Customise – Design personal avatars, build custom worlds in VR and Browser, and shape digital spaces tailored to unique interests. A select few users also have access to a PC-based world builder for advanced creation.
- Play and Compete – Engage in interactive games and experiences created by users or participate in Meta-hosted events.

## Exploring Meta Horizons A Gateway to Personal Virtual Worlds

For those looking to enter Meta Horizons, the process is straightforward. Users can create an account, personalise their avatar, and immediately begin exploring various virtual spaces. More importantly, Meta Horizons allows users the freedom to build their own virtual worlds in VR and Browser, with a select few having access to a PC builder. This ability to shape personal environments fosters creativity and connection, enabling people to design spaces tailored to their interests and communities. Whether it is a collaborative workspace, a social lounge, or a fantastical realm, the flexibility in world-building empowers users to create meaningful digital experiences.

As part of FoVR Interactive's commitment to exploring XR technology, we have built a world that you can explore within Meta Horizons. This world serves as a virtual art exhibit featuring works from Australian artists, allowing visitors to view and read about their art in an immersive setting. By blending digital spaces with real-world culture, it highlights how Meta Horizons can be used as a medium for education, creativity, and appreciation of the arts.

## Comparing Meta Horizons with Other Metaverse Platforms

Several other metaverse platforms have emerged over the years, each attempting to build a shared digital space, but not all have succeeded in creating an accessible and engaging experience. While platforms like VRChat and Rec Room offer deep customisation and social interaction, they often require more technical expertise or focus on gaming rather than open-ended world-building. Decentraland, on the other hand, integrates blockchain and cryptocurrency, making it less accessible for those unfamiliar with the technology. Meta Horizons, with its blend of ease of use, accessibility across multiple devices, and social-driven engagement, stands out as a metaverse that welcomes everyone.

## Beyond the Young and Tech Savvy Including the Elderly in the Metaverse

While the metaverse often appeals to younger audiences and early tech adopters we must also recognise the immense potential it holds for older generations. Many elderly individuals face mobility challenges that limit their ability to travel socialise or experience new adventures. Meta Horizons presents an opportunity to change that.

Through virtual travel seniors can visit places they might never have had the chance to see from historical landmarks to serene natural landscapes. They can also engage in social activities, participate in group discussions or even attend virtual concerts and events. By designing spaces that cater to the needs of older users such as intuitive navigation simplified controls and meaningful engagement opportunities we can ensure that the metaverse becomes a place for all generations not just the technologically inclined.

## Where Meta Horizons Can Improve

While Meta Horizons provides a strong foundation, there are several areas where it could improve:

- Expanded Cross-Platform Support – Adding PlayStation VR or Nintendo Switch support would make the platform more accessible.

- Enhanced Privacy and Social Control – Introducing better privacy settings that allow users to control their experience between worlds, ensuring they are not automatically placed in large public groups unless they choose to be.

- Age Filters and Personalised Spaces – Features that let users control their social experience by selecting spaces suited to their preferences, including options for private or introvert-friendly spaces.

## Meta Horizons A Future of Connection and Inclusion

At FoVR Interactive, we believe that the metaverse should be built around people, accessibility, and creativity. Meta Horizons is one step toward creating virtual environments that are truly inclusive, providing opportunities for learning, art, and social engagement. As we continue to develop XR experiences, we aim to contribute to shaping the metaverse into a more open and connected digital world.
